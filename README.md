# Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Abstract Schemas

This repository contains abstract schemas (format-independent Information Models) for several SBOM standards,
some of which define multiple data models.  Deriving multiple DMs from a single IM ensures content
consistency and enables seamless bridging between data formats.
